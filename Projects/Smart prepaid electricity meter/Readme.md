Explanation of Code Functionality
Setup and Initialization: The setup function initializes serial communication for GSM and the LCD display. It also reads the initial balance from EEPROM and sets up Firebase.
Loop Function: The loop continuously reads energy consumption from the CT sensor and updates the remaining units. It checks if the balance is below certain thresholds to send alerts or disconnect power.
Reading Energy Meter: The readEnergyMeter function simulates reading from a CT sensor. In a real application, this should be replaced with actual logic to read energy consumption.
Sending Alerts: The sendLowBalanceAlert function sends an SMS alert when the balance drops below ten units.
Disconnecting Power: When the balance reaches zero, the system disconnects power by controlling a relay and sounds a buzzer for alert.
Firebase Integration: The code updates Firebase with the current status of remaining units for remote monitoring.
Note:
Replace placeholders like your_wifi_ssid, your_firebase_host, your_firebase_auth, and your_phone_number with actual values.
Ensure proper wiring and connections according to your hardware specifications.
This code provides a comprehensive solution for a smart prepaid electricity meter system integrating various functionalities as requested.
